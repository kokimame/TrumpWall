# Trump Wall Breakout
This is a Breakout clone powered by [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). 

I developed this Android game in March 2016 and haven't finished it. (The GIF below is almost everything of the "game")

The game concept was inspired by political issues in the U.S. at that time.
The concept is pretty simple: Mr. Trump grins when he collides with an immigrant.
